# PEARL: In GitHub, the output of `dotnet build` looks completely different from what it looks when building locally.
#        For example, the output of "Message" tasks is not shown, even when "Importance" is set to "High".
#        The "-ConsoleLoggerParameters:off" magical incantation corrects this problem.
# PEARL-ON-PEARL: The "-ConsoleLoggerParameters:off" magical incantation does not work when invoking `dotnet build`
#        locally. In this case, the "-TerminalLogger:off" magical incantation is necessary.
#        So, we use -TerminalLogger:off here too, for consistency.
